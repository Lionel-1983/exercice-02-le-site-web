# exercice-02-le-site-web

HTML and CSS  responsive page with media queries.

Everything is in flexbox.

The main content (Main is restricted 85% of width), 

therefore the menu (nav) is at 100% of width with a padding of 15% 

(100% - 85%) which is divided by two thanks to the calc function to distribute this 15% to the right and to the left.

We add a max-width: 100% to restrict the images. See the complete files: exercise-02-le-site-web.
